    <h3 class="episode-title">One time...</h3>
    <p class="episode">I accidentally swallowed a fly. Didn't see it. It came out of nowhere and I'm pretty sure it was
      yellow in
      colour, which, on reflection is quite odd for a fly. Owing to the urgency with which I wanted to exit the fly from
      my digestive tract, I did not spend too long pondering this odd colouring, not in the moment. Instead, I searched
      for a spider to swallow, to catch the fly, as is the traditional remedy. I knew there were a few spiders in the
      corners of the shed windows, so I went to retrieve one. While skipping down the garden, I tripped; I'm not sure
      why or how, I know how to skip, must have been some uneven ground or a bit of debris left in the way by the dog.
      Falling hard on my front, I hit my chest on the ground and the result was a sort of self-induced heimlich. Out
      flew the fly. This was a great lesson for me in taking action. Making some sort of move, even towards a less than
      perfect plan. The spider was not needed after all, thank goodness. Nonetheless, making moves on my initial plan
      led to an
      even easier course to victory being realised. </p>
    <h3 class="episode-title">Another time...</h3>
    <p class="episode">It was a Sunday afternoon and I was walking along the seafront when I came accross an eggshell
      person. He was sat
      on a wall. I passed him with my usual brief, polite greeting and slight head tip, and was on my way. Within only a
      few paces, I was already turning back to the figure, having heard a yell and a crashing sound behind me. The
      eggshell person was in pieces on the ground. I ran to help him, and beckoned the nearby King's horses and King's
      men to help me. The eggshell person was able to speak and he told me his name was Humpty. Unusual, I thought.
      We willing helpers tried all sorts of tricks and ideas through which we had hoped to put Humpty together
      again, but all of our attempts failed. I was visibly demoralised and frustrated. But then Humpty asked me, if I
      couldn't change what had happened and I couldn't fix something to be exactly as it were before, what were my
      options? I supposed
      that they were, to think about what was next, so I asked Humpty what he would like to do, where he would like to
      go, from where he was at that moment.
      He told me he'd always quite fancied being a seashell. With this, I scooped him up and layed him next to the sea,
      to his delight and contentment. </p>
    <h3 class="episode-title">And on another occasion...</h3>
    <p class="episode">I was once on a mission, a professional quest if you will, to restore a magic stone to the heart
      of the Island
      from which it was stolen, in order to return prosperity to the world. I had the best team around me, I'd packed
      all the right gear and even tied my hair up in a stylish and practical bun. I was prepared. I was ready to fight.
      Problem was, when I reached the island and faced it's terrifying guard, I was overcome with a sense that this
      guard was not my enemy. I convinced the guard to engage in a dialogue with me, through which I discovered that she
      was the righful proprietaire of the magic stone. I gave it to her without hesitation and immediately, health and
      vitality was restored to the world. </p>
